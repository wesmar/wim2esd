Console-based WIM to ESD Converter
Overview
This console-based C++ program, named wim2esd_x64.exe for 64-bit systems or wim2esd_x86.exe for 32-bit or 64-bit systems, is designed to convert all indices from an install.wim file in Windows 11 to a single install.esd file. The conversion utilizes the highest level of compression available.

Usage
Preparation: Ensure the install.wim file is placed in a writable directory.

Execution: Place wim2esd_x64.exe or wim2esd_x86.exe in the same writable directory as the install.wim file.

Running the Program: Run the program with administrator privileges to start the conversion process. The program will automatically detect, list, and convert all indices from install.wim to install.esd.

Details
Compression: Uses recovery compression to achieve the smallest possible ESD file size.

Performance: The conversion process can be time-consuming, especially on less powerful machines. The total duration may exceed one hour depending on system specifications and the number of indices.

Example Command
Execute the program in the directory containing the install.wim file:
wim2esd_x86.exe

Notes
Ensure you have the necessary administrative privileges to perform the conversion.
The program operates without prompts, making it ideal for automated or batch processing scenarios.
